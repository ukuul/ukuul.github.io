          <p>RISKS AND INSURANCE</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Ukuul will only reimburse you for actual loss of or damage to any items being delivered while in Ukuul’s Possession (as defined herein below) up to a maximum reimbursement of GHS100 per delivery, provided however that any reimbursement hereunder may not exceed the total value of the original delivery. For purposes hereof, an item shall be deemed to be in “Ukuul’s Possession” from the point Ukuul collects the item from you until the item reaches the end destination. Any insurance must be purchased separately from an insurance provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a delivery is lost or damaged while in Ukuul’s Possession , you may file a claim with Ukuul for reimbursement. All claims must be initiated within seven (7) days of the mailing date by contacting us at hello@ukuul.com where we will provide more details on how to file a claim. The original receipt of the delivery label and an image or photograph of the damaged item may be required when filing a claim. If the recipient accepts the delivery without noting any damage on the delivery record, we will assume the delivery was delivered in good condition. In order for us to consider a claim for damage, the contents, original delivery cartons, and packing must be available to us for inspection. Written documentation (such as a receipt) supporting the amount of a claim will also be required. All supporting documentation must be submitted within 30 days of claim initiation (45 days of mailing date) of the mailing date.

            <li>
              You may not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of Ukuul, in which case, Ukuul may charge a transfer fee. Ukuul may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction.
