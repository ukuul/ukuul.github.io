              Ukuul Limited (“Ukuul”, “we” or “us”) provides its Service (as defined in clause 2a below) to you, subject to these Terms. By accepting these Terms or by accessing or using the Services or our website located at www.ukuul.com (the “Site”), you acknowleddge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company, business or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these Terms, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these Terms you must not accept these Terms and may not use the Service and will attract personal liability for the obligations contracted herein. Any reference in these Terms to “Party” shall be construed as a reference to either you or us, as the context may require and “Parties” shall be a reference to both you and us collectively.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these Terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Services user interface, in an email notification, with a text message or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective  immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              You will be required to register with Ukuul in order to access and use the features of the Service.

Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use the Service, with or without registering. In addition, if you are under 18 years old, you may use the Service, with or without registering, only with the approval of your parent or guardian.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              In addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such services that may be posted on the Service from time to time, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy located at www.ukuul.com. All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms.

          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;GENERAL CONDITIONS / ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICE&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;

              &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              Any software that may be made available by Ukuul in connection with the Service, including without limitation the bookmarklets or plug-ins, (“Software”) contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, Ukuul hereby grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive right and license to use the object code of any Software solely in connection with the Service, provided that you shall not (and shall not allow any third Party to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or sell, assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any right in any Software.

              You are solely responsible for all data, information, feedback, suggestions, text, content and other materials that you upload, post, deliver, provide or otherwise transmit or store (hereafter “post(ing)”) in connection with or relating to the Service (“Your Content”).You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login, password and account and for all activities that occur under your login or account.

Ukuul has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the Service, Content, or Your Content and to disclose Your Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to –
              &lt;ol type=&#34;i&#34;&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;comply with a legal obligation;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;protect and defend the rights or property of Ukuul;&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;protect against legal liability.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              You further agree that Ukuul may remove or disable any of Your Content at any time for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third Parties or authorities relating to such Content), or for no reason at all.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              You understand that the operation of the Service, including Your Content, may be unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices and (c) transmission to Ukuul’s third Party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Service. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of Your Content. Ukuul will have no liability to you for any unauthorized access or use of any of Your Content, or any corruption, deletion, destruction or loss of any of Your Content.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              You shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use the Services, including, without limitation, browsers, modems, hardware, servers, software, operating system, networking, web servers and internet service (collectively, “Equipment”).

You shall also be responsible for maintaining the security of the Equipment, your Account, passwords (including but not limited to administrative and user passwords) and files, and for all uses of your Account or the Equipment with or without your knowledge or consent.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              The failure of Ukuul to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be a waiver of that right. You acknowledge that these Terms is a contract between you and Ukuul, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Ukuul, and it governs your use of the Service and takes the place of any prior agreements between you and Ukuul.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              Subject to the terms hereof, Ukuul may (but has no obligation to) provide technical support services, through email, sms or in-app via push notifications in accordance with our standard practice.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;PAYMENT&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              Payment for the Service requires the use of a virtual wallet (“Wallet”) attached to your Ukuul account. Funds can be added to Wallet via credit card, mobile money or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to Ukuul that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. Funds deposited into Wallet are immediately non refundable. This no refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate your usage, our decision to terminate your usage, disruption caused to the Service either planned, accidental or intentional, or any reason whatsoever.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              When you arrange for delivery, all charges for the delivery and any additional fees payable to Ukuul (“Charges”) will be charged to your Wallet. You hereby authorize Ukuul to bill your Wallet for Charges in accordance with these Terms. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties, all charges, fees, or surcharges shall be those in effect at the time of delivery, available either via email, on the Site or in-app. The applicable Charges will be based upon the characteristics of the delivery actually tendered to us. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by us. We will use reasonable efforts to inform you of changes that may apply to you regarding the Charges, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred on your account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amount thereof, but your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              You are responsible for providing accurate and complete delivery information to Ukuul, including service selected, number, weight, and dimensions of deliveries. If any aspect of the delivery information is incomplete or incorrect as determined by Ukuul in its sole discretion, Ukuul may adjust the Charges at any time.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;CASH HANDLING&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Cash payment and collection (“Cash Handling”) through the Service attracts a Charge, which Ukuul reserves the right to adjust at its sole discretion.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Cash Handling is provided without any guarantees. In the event of loss, robbery, fraud and/or forgery Ukuul is not required to reimburse you part or full amount and/or Charge. However, Ukuul will do everything in its capacity to ensure you always get your cash paid and/or settled.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

                  Your Content and other activities in connection with the Service, and Ukuul’s exercise of all rights and license granted by you herein, do not and will not violate, infringe, or misappropriate any third Party’s copyright, trademark, right of privacy or publicity, or other personal or proprietary right, nor does Your Content contain any matter that is defamatory, obscene, unlawful, threatening, abusive, tortious, offensive or harassing; and

Also, Ukuul may terminate these Terms immediately without notice if you violate any provision of the AUP, as determined in Ukuul’s sole reasonable discretion. Ukuul reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof).

            &lt;li&gt;
              Under no circumstances and under no legal theory (whether in contract, delict, tort, or otherwise) shall Ukuul be liable to you or any third Party for -
              &lt;ol type=&#34;i&#34;&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, consequential or punitive damages, including lost profits, lost sales or business, lost data, or&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;any direct damages, costs, losses or liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              The provisions of this section allocate the risks under these Terms between the Parties, and the Parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into these Terms.

            &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;INDEMNIFICATION&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;You hereby defend, indemnify, and hold Ukuul harmless from and against all claims, actions or demands, including without limitation all legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from your breach of these Terms, any of Your Content, or your other access, contribution to, use or misuse of the Service. Ukuul shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit or demand. Ukuul reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this clause. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Ukuul’s defense of such matter.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;RISKS AND INSURANCE&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              Ukuul will only reimburse you for actual loss of or damage to any items being delivered while in Ukuul’s Possession (as defined herein below) up to a maximum reimbursement of GHS100 per delivery, provided however that any reimbursement hereunder may not exceed the total value of the original delivery. For purposes hereof, an item shall be deemed to be in “Ukuul’s Possession” from the point Ukuul collects the item from you until the item reaches the end destination. Any insurance must be purchased separately from an insurance provider.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              If a delivery is lost or damaged while in Ukuul’s Possession , you may file a claim with Ukuul for reimbursement. All claims must be initiated within seven (7) days of the mailing date by contacting us at hello@ukuul.com where we will provide more details on how to file a claim. The original receipt of the delivery label and an image or photograph of the damaged item may be required when filing a claim. If the recipient accepts the delivery without noting any damage on the delivery record, we will assume the delivery was delivered in good condition. In order for us to consider a claim for damage, the contents, original delivery cartons, and packing must be available to us for inspection. Written documentation (such as a receipt) supporting the amount of a claim will also be required. All supporting documentation must be submitted within 30 days of claim initiation (45 days of mailing date) of the mailing date.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;ASSIGNMENT&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
              You may not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of Ukuul, in which case, Ukuul may charge a transfer fee. Ukuul may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;
